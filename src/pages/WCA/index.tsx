            In 2018, we hosted a summit on Child Sexual Abuse in partnership
            with Girls Not Brides UK, followed by a six-month campaign to end
            child marriage, culminating in a summit on 26 May 2022. Our summits
            are not mere talking shops; instead, we bring stakeholders together
            to develop solutions, documented in a communiqu√© that outlines
            actionable steps to address our findings. This approach has enabled
            us to impact over 25,000 women, children, and young people
            conservatively over the years.

            In 2023, we shifted our focus to the boy child. Whilst our coalition
            members, Women Community in Africa, and other Non-Governmental
            Organisations have primarily concentrated on the girl child, we
            recognise that neglecting the boy child could undermine our
            progress. One boy child can potentially undo the gains made for the
            girl child, as boys and men often perpetrate the dangers faced by
            girls. Therefore, we believe it is essential to give equal attention
            to the boy child.
          </div>
          <div className="mt-5">
            The most effective solution is to nurture and re-engineer the boy
            child to embrace values that align with our mission, enabling them
            to collaborate with us and understand the importance of protecting
            and developing every girl child. When girl children are
            well-developed- mentally, intellectually, and financially - they
            become a vast, resourceful ecosystem that supports the sustainable
            development goals in their communities.
